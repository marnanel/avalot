         AVALOT - Pedigree file.

         (If you don't know what that is, read AVALOT.DOC)

Please add: number, name (or nickname), rough geographical location, how you 
got hold of the program, and any comments. Please don't add something stupid 
like "Odysseus, 3024 BC, Island of Ogygia, borrowed scroll containing file 
from Calypso's BBS" as it makes these lists unreliable. Thanks!
