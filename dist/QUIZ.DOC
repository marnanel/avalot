 3. When did the ringers ring a peal?
 4. Who is the ringers' captain?
 5. What (hopefully) has beef put in to flavour it?
 6. What is the main theme of the pictures in the Art Gallery?
 7. Who is the Reverend H.G. Quicksilver?
 8. What is the Trebouchet Song better known as?
 9. Who loves brown ale?
10. What is the Baron's family motto?
11. Where did Iby NOT live it up?
12. Who is Spurge's uncle?
13. What can cut its way through eight feet of stone (but nobody knows how)?
14. Who needs your help to get back home?
15. What is an Englishman's castle?
16. Who is the Welsh Rabbit?
17. Who can't swim?
18. What is an impressive bit of architecture?
