You wander through the forest for a while, and eventually come upon a leafy glade, wherein stands a friar."Gweetings!" he says. "Ha! That witch won't mess with ME again! I took all her money!"2Hmm...Do you usually rob witches?1Well, Wobbin told me to wob the witch, so I've just been and wobbed her.2Aha! You're beginning to understand.No, no, not witches, as in broomsticks. He meant rob the RICH. People with lots of money.1A strange look crosses the friar's face.Who says?2I do.1And who are you?2Lord Avalot d'Argent.1LORD Avalot d'Argent? You're a Norman?2Yes, why?1A witch Norman?2Ummmmmmmmm......1Come with me!2(It looks like you've talked yourself into a bit of a problem, Avvy...)
