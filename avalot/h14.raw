The ready light shows different patterns according
to what you're doing. When you're on the menus, the
light is covered with little rectangles. If you're
reading a scroll, the light displays thick and thin
green lines. Otherwise, the light is either plain
green, when you're moving Avvy around and typing
things in, or off, when the computer is busy and you
have an hourglass pointer.
