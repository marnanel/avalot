A list of all the places you can get points in Avalot.

1) ROOMS

You can get ONE point by walking for the first time into any room

(This is indicated by the "S" (for Score) flag being set.)

Altogether, this makes a total of 32 points.

Note that this figure changes all the time.

2) SHOOT-'EM-UP

You can get points in the shoot-'em-up, maximum 20. (This is your score in
