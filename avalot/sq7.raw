I've been playing this game since..."`Well," you butt in before he forgets, `where's my groat?"Dogfood starts guiltily.`I... er... drank it." he says, holding up his three-quarters-empty glass of brown ale as proof. `Er... sorry..."`That's not good enough!" you say. `Where's my money?"`Um... I tell you what. You can have my lute. Lovely, it is. Only third-hand. Thanks for the drinks. Bye." And he returns to Brown Ale Land.
