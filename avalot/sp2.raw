Spludwick is your castle's resident alchemist. He's wearing a dark blue cloak, down to his ankles, a floppy hat, also dark blue, and a pair of dark blue slippers (the kind with hard soles that flip-flop about when you walk), brown hair, and brown eyes.His main job is to discover a way of turning lead into gold, which is, of course, impossible (he knows this, but won't admit it), and he often participates in research projects for the English Guild of Alchemists.
