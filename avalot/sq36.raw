Gulp!FWhat happens to me now?Well, I really ought to wob you and let you go, but I think Wobbin needs someone to help him this afternoon in the Wyatt.2(Wyatt? Wyatt who?)What's a Wyatt?FYou know, people thwowing eggs at the Shewiff, stuff like that.2Oh, a RIOT! Got one planned, have you?FYes, but Wobbin asked me to get somebody else to do the actual, um, egg-thwowing, you see. We pwovide the eggs, you chuck them at people.2And you'll let me go after that?FHmmm.. might do, might not. You'll just have to wait. I don't know what Wobbin's going to do.2With that, he wuns (er, whoops, Runs) away.
