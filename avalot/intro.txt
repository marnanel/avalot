Our story starts on a tiny island
off the coast of the Lleyn Peninsula,
Gwynedd, Wales. The isle is called
Ynys Enlli by those who live there,
but in English its name is BARDSEY.

The island has been a monarchy for
many years. Tonight, the King
of Bardsey, SIR GERALD WINTERWATER,
sits down to a quiet game of shove
ha'penny with his beautiful only
daughter, GEIDA.

Suddenly...
there is a rattling at the door.
`Owpen! Owpen the dowwur!"
cries a voice.

One of the King's few guards
hurries up.

`Your Majesty," he cries, `there's a
Brummie knight without who craves
entrance!"

`Well, he can stay without for all
I care." says the King, who is annoyed
at being interrupted at a crucial stage
in his game. `Pass the mead."

`But, Sire, he wants your daughter's
hand in marriage!" says the guard.

`He can go without her, too." the King
replies.

Just at that moment, the door bursts
open, and a tall baron stands in the
doorway. `Sir Gerald!" he declaims,
`I claim your daughter's hand!"

`Go away." says the King, waving his
ha'penny at the Baron.

`Then, Sire, I shall hold your
daughter to ransom!" He motions to one
of his guards, who strides forward to
grab her.

She knocks him to the ground. But even
Geida cannot repel twelve strong
knights. Soon she is bound up
with rope.

`Fifty pounds if you want her back."
smirks the Baron.

`FIFTY POUNDS?!" says the King faintly.
`œ50? You could buy Essex for that!"

`Exactly." says the Baron. He claps his
hands, and the guards begin to drag
Geida away.

`Wait!" calls Sir Gerald. `I had a
letter from the Duke of Cardiff this
morning saying that he was going to
give away Essex and Cornwall in a
prize draw. Why don't you enter that?"

`Sir Gerald," says the Baron, `don't
be a fool. If you haven't got œ50,
get it. Soon."

He starts to go out of the door.
`Never trifle with Baron du Lustie!"

`You won't get away with this!" calls
the King. `I have friends in high
places! I'll get the best knight in
England to win her back!"

`Who?"
enquires the Baron sarcastically.
`Lord Avalot d'Argent?"

`I'm serious. Sir Roamalot of Romford."

`You haven't got a hope, Sir Gerald.
Pay up." With that, du Lustie leaves
the throneroom. Soon he is on his way
back to Warwickshire, to lock Geida
up in his deepest dungeon...
