Our serf has selected YOUR numbers from millions of others to be eligible to win the GIVEAWAY of a LIFETIME!!!`Here's what YOU could win:A braille copy of the Karma Sutra! Just think how that could liven up those long HERTFORDSHIRE winter evenings!!!`A new, taxed, and insured carriage-and-four GTi! Just imagine- you could be the envy of the whole of ARGENT!!!`You could even win the entire Duchy of Cornwall!

Now scratch off the silver to see what your prize could be!!!"On the accompanying card, there are four squares covered in a kind of congealed silver gunge. You scrape off the one marked `nine".Underneath, it says: `CONGRATULATIONS!!! You could win the JACKPOT!!! The Duchy of Cornwall could ALREADY be yours!!!" At the bottom of the card, it says: `Apply to Cardiff Castle to enter your numbers in the draw." In minute print below that, you can just about read: `Not all numbers may win a prize. We are obliged to mention this by law but we don't see the sense in making a song and dance about it."Hmmm...Anyway, my lord, I have work to do, rearranging the beer bottles. Will there be anything else?No, no, you can go and get on.1Thanks, my lord. Bye!2Bye.1
