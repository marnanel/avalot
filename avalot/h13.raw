 The "thinks" box
The thinks box displays what Avvy is thinking about.
It could be an object you are carrying, like the bell,
or it could be a person in the room you're in, such as
Spludwick. If you look at an object or person, or
select an object or person off the menu, this will
come up in the thinks box. Afterwards you can refer to
whatever is in the "thinks" box as "him", "her" or
"it", depending on what it is.

If you click on the "thinks" box with the mouse, you
will look at whatever is in the box.
