Hello.2Er... hello.1Have you come to rescue me?2Um... yes.1Great. Are you Sir Roamalot of Romford, then?2No - he asked me to come instead. I'm Lord Avalot d'Argent.1You get the impression that Geida is trying her hardest not to laugh.Right. You say you're a lord? You look more like a monk to me.2No, I'm in disguise. This is how I got past Baron du Lustie.1And you want to take me back to Bardsey?2Yes, but we'll have to get past the Baron first.1Hmmm... yes, that could be tricky...2Maybe you could wear a disguise too.1We haven't got one. Anyway, this frock IS a disguise. The Baron ordered me to wear it so that I wouldn't be rescued.2Why?1He said nobody would rescue a damsel in this dress.2Geida, aren't you pleased to be rescued?1Avalot, your reputation for competence in the dashing quest department is hardly such a one as to inspire my confidence.2Aren't you coming, then?1No, I think I'll just sit here and wait for a rescuer who stands a chance of getting me back home!2Am I really that famous for incompetent rescues?1Avvy, you can't even SWIM! Really, no offence, you're a very nice man, I'd love to meet you if I was at a party, but since I'm in a dungeon I'll stay here. Thanks anyway.2
