All...Bexplains the monk, as he swallows another mouthful of mild,...is not well.What's wrong?1Well, I was sent on a pilgrimage to Rome...B(hmmm... why does that remind you of something?)...and I brought back a pilgrim's badge as proof. Now I've been mugged and they stole the badge.BThat's awful!1That's not the half of it. If Ayles doesn't see the badge he might think I've been living it up in Wheathampstead for the last two years instead of trudging along foriegn roads.BOh, no, I know Ayles, he's ever such a nice chap.1Yes, but I'm well known among the monks for deviousness. I was only sent on the pilgrimage because I'd dressed up as a nun in order to fool Ayles into letting me into the beer cellar.BHmm... did the robbers leave you with anything?1Only the habit I was wearing, and another one. They're not really comfortable clothes, you know, I'm not surprised they didn't take them.B
