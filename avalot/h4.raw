Joystick Support
5
Unless you set the joystick up using the setup
program, you will not be able to use it.

 To switch joystick control on, press Ctrl-J. To
  turn it off and keyboard/mouse control on,
  press Ctrl-K.

 Avalot will move in the direction the stick is
  pointing in.

 The left button will open a door, the same as f7.

 The right button means "look". This is equivalent
  to f8.
