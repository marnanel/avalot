Hi, Avvy. How's life?2Well... I've just got a letter asking me to take over somebody's quest.1If you're feeling like going on a quest, try going and getting me some ingredients for this research I'm doing- it's a new potion for the English Guild of Alchemists. Could you get me an onion, please?2
