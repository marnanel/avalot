Mouse Support (page 1 of 2)

Avalot is designed so that you can do most things
using your rodent (unlike Avaricius).

 You can use the menus with the mouse just like OS/2
  or Windows. When the mouse is over the menu bar, the
  pointer will turn into an upwards-pointing arrow,
  and when you select an option off a drop-down menu,
  the pointer will become a right-pointing arrow.

 When the mouse is over the picture, the pointer will
  become an arrow that looks like a real arrow. If you
  click and hold the left mouse button, the pointer
  will become cross-hairs ("+" shape). Avalot will try
  to walk towards the point at which the hairs cross.
