Fwiar Tuck is a fat, jolly man in a bwown habit, tied around his middle with a cord. He's even more jolly now than usual, because he's just come back from the Boar's Head, but even so, his devotions to duty, food and beer still know no bounds. There is one small pwoblem with his diction, though; he's unable to pwonounce his `r"s cowwectly.
