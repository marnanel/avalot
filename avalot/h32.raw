Miscellaneous problems
\""""""""""""""""""""""
 "I get told to close all applications, exit Windows
  and restart my computer when I run Avalot from
  Windows".

If you wish to run Avalot from Windows, digital sound
and music must be switched off-- use the setup program
to do this. Sorry.

 "Avalot will not run in a window in Windows"

Windows can't cope with the way Avalot writes directly
to your computer's screen memory. This means that
Avalot must be run "full-screen".
