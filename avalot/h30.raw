      Key   What it does
\      ===   ============
 ctrl-Left  Moves it one space backwards.
ctrl-Right  ...forwards.
Backspace   Its usual function.
      Del   Ditto.
   Escape   Gets you in or out of the drop-down menus,
            or does the same banishing trick as Enter.
 Plus (+)   Usually just adds a + sign, but also
            banishes scrolls.
    Pause   Pauses the entire computer until you press
            a key (as usual.)

Just about anything else gets added onto the end of
the command line.
