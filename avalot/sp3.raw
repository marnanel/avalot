`Look at Crapulus?" You wish you hadn't! Since the age of approximately five years old he has been walking around in a permanent alcoholic stupor, interspersed at frequent intervals by hangovers. You can smell him approaching from twenty yards (roll on, the days of deodorants) and his favourite menu for lunch is bad for the liver, but good for washing your hair in. Also, as the only serf who's ever around on your ever-decreasing castle staff, he is now, unfortunately, in charge of everything from washing-up to castle security. Hence the expression `security is tight."It's sad, really. He's just drinking his life away. Both his brain, which wasn't huge in the first place, and his liver are attacked daily by a fresh barrage of alcohol, and both of them are much the worse for wear. Oh well, at least he never gets violent.It might be a good idea for him to get in touch with Alcoholics Anonymous, but unfortunately he'll have to wait about 800 years until it's set up...
