Mouse Support (page 2 of 2)

 When you move the mouse over the text entry line, it
  turns into an "I"-bar, that is, a kind of pointer
  that will move the cursor to the postion in the
  text you point and click at.

 If the mouse is placed on top of the toolbar, it
  will become a screwdriver. See the help page on the
  toolbar for more information.

 When the computer is busy, the green "ready" light
  will go out (see the page on the toolbar), and the
  mouse pointer will turn into an hourglass.

 To get rid of a scroll, click anywhere.
