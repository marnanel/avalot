 "My joystick does not make Avalot move."

Before using your joystick, you must first select
"Joystick Setup" off the main menu of the setup
program.

Avalot only supports IBM-compatible joysticks. If you
have one, first check that your joystick is plugged
in properly. If it is, try pressing ctrl-J to switch
joystick mode on. If it still doesn't work, it may be
that your joystick is badly adjusted-- run the
joystick part of the setup program again.
