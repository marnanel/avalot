Hi. Who are you?1I'm Dogfood the minstrel.AHe continues to play with his little stones.Can you give us a song?1Like what?AOh, I don't know... Greensleeves?1Mmm.. no... don't like that one...AWhat about the Coventry Carol?1'S a bit unseasonal!AWell, how about that song about trebouchets?1Dogfood seems surprised.A song about trebouchets?AYes, you know... "Help Me Make It Throw The Knight"?1Oh, that... The chords are a bit tricky...AHe suddenly changes the subject.Have you seen this thing with the stones? It's my favourite game.he explains. He takes another gulp of brown ale, then continues:It's quite simple. There are three piles of stones, and whosever's turn it is gets to take as many stones as they like, provided that they only take from one pile at a time. The person who takes the LAST stone wins the game. Understand?
