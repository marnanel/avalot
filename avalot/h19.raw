How to play Nim
1
Nim is a game played with three piles of stones, one
containing three, one four and one five. Each player
has a turn, in which he can take as many as he likes,
but only from one pile in one turn. Play continues
until one player empties the last pile.
That player wins.

Hint: Arithmetic Progressions are the key!
