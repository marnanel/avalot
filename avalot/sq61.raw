You try to open the door, but find you cannot. It's locked. You dig in your pocket for a key, but you have none; it seems that you'll have to see where you can find one. What a shame...Since you haven't yet found the key, I will tell you this: You will find the place where the key really lies when you try the place where truth reputedly lies. (Well, at least you know the way this far, so there's no point whining about it.)
