SOUND
 Avalot supports Pro AudioSpectrums, SoundBlasters and
  other sound cards, but in the setup program, you'll need
  to say that you have one and give technical information 
  about it before Avalot can use it. If you don't, then 
  Avalot will only use the plain PC speaker.

 There are several pieces of music in the game, all
  composed or transcribed by Thomas Thurman:

Title                  Composer     When it is played
"""""                  """"""""     """""""""""""""""
"Go to Joan Glover"    Traditional  When you read "The story
                                    so far" off the main

                                    loaded, and the main
